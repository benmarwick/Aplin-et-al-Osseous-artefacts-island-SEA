Key to codes used in Aplin-et-al-Osseous-artefacts-island-SEA data (prepared by Ken Aplin)
					
					
Morphtype: B = bipoint; E = expedient (used but otherwise unmodified); F = fragment; G = ground piece; S = shaft frag; Sp = spatula; T = tip of point; U = unipoint (ignore Spr and Pr - possible preforms)	
					
Breakage: A = during or after excavation; B = old break; N = complete; U = uncertain	
					
Bipoint condition: C = complete; 1 = one tip missing; 2 = both tips missing	
					
Raw mat.: C = cortex bone splinter; D = dentine; S = long bone shaft	
					
Burning Overall: U = unburnt; B = burnt; C = calcined	
					
Focal Burn: N = no; Y = yes	
					
Manufact method: C = shaving; SL = scraping longitudinal; GL = grinding longit; GT = grinding transverse; GO = grinding oblique; GI = grinding indeterminate; I = indeterminate; N = none	

					
Tip Shape primary end: these describe X-section near tip	
					
Tip damage PE: C = crushing; T = transverse snap; S = step fracture; I = indeterminate; u = undamaged	
					
Tip Use Wear PE: ch = chipping of enamel rim; C0= coarse oblique striae; CT = coarse transverse striae; F = fine oblique striae; F = fine transverse striae; LP = light polish; HP = high polish; I = indeterminate; N = unworn
